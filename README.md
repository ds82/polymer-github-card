# polymer-github-card

&lt;github-card&gt; with polymer
This is a polymer port of [pazguille's](https://github.com/pazguille) great [github-card webcomponent](https://github.com/pazguille/github-card)

## Why?

I had some problems to use pazguille original webcomponent and wanted to get into polymer for a while.
