This is a polymer port of [pazguille's](https://github.com/pazguille) great [github-card webcomponent](https://github.com/pazguille/github-card).

## Why?

I had some problems to use pazguille original webcomponent and wanted to get into polymer for a while. It's my first polymer component and surely needs improvement. While my first goal was to port pazguille version, I plan to add some features..
